# Methods

The Poudre River at Lincoln Bridge is:

  - Downstream of only a little bit of urban stormwater

  - Near Odell Brewing CO
  
  - Near an open space area and the Poudre River Trail
  
  - **Downstream of many agricultral diversions**

### Data Download


```{r downloader}

q <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = '06752260',
                parameterCd = '00060',
                startDate = '2017-01-01',
                endDate = '2022-01-01') %>%
  rename(q = 'X_00060_00003')

# Assignment. 


This assignment will be primarily about demonstrating some expertice in using
RMarkdown, since we will be using Rmds as the primary form of homework and 
assignments. With that in mind, your assignment for this homework is to:


1) Fork the example repository into your personal GitHub - COMPLETE

2) Create an RStudio project from your Personal clone of the Repo. - COMPLETE

3) Create a table of contents that is floating, but displays three levels of
headers instead of two (by editing the content at the beginning of the document) -COMPLETE

4) Make a version of the `dygraph` with points and lines by using rstudio's
dygraph [guide](https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/) - COMPLETE

5) Writing a paragraph on the Poudre river with at least three hyperlinks,
**two bolded sections**, and one *italicized phrase*. The content of this paragraph
is not vital, but try to at least make it true and interesting, and, of course,
don't plagiarize. - COMPLETE

6) Knit that document, and then git commit and push to your personal GitHub.- COMPLETE

7) Use the GitHub -> Settings -> Pages tab to create a website of your report. -COMPLETE

8) Bonus, make the timestamp in the header dynamic. As in it only adds
todays date, not just a static date you enter. - COMPLETE 

9) <font size="6"> **CHECK OUT SLIDES HERE**</font> Bonus, create an ["index_talk.Rmd"](https://rpubs.com/lekokremer/ESS580A7_1_RMD_Homework1) version of your document using the
`revealjs` package. Add link to your original report-style document. - COMPLETE


## DyGraph example. 
```{r}
q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)

dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") %>%
  dyOptions(drawPoints = TRUE, pointSize = 3, pointShape = "star", colors = 'green') 
```

## Poudre Paragraph

The Poudre River has gone through many changes over time, most notably in the urban [transition zone](https://watercenter.colostate.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2019/05/Fish-in-the-Poudres-Thermal-and-Habitat-Transition-Zone-by-Boyd-Wright.pdf). Within this zone, bed armoring along the banks has created flow conditions within the Poudre River that behave more like a **plumbing system** than a natural river. Natural rivers have a variety of multi-braided side-channels and oxbows as the main channel carves through the floodplain [(Poff 1997)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1313099). In the Poudre transition zone, however, the river floodplain has been heavily developed and the river itself has become increasingly channelized, bermed, and armored over time as a result. More than two-thirds of the riverbank within the urban zone is armored to provide resilience against floods and other high flow-events (Shanahan et al. 2016). The armoring of banks with riprap or concrete disconnects the river channel from its floodplain, eliminating the natural ability of the river to carve through the floodplain and form a more sinuous and diverse channel for aquatic species to seek refuge in during times of high temperatures or low flows.
